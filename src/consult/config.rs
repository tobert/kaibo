//! The per-phase config ladder, mirroring the tool ladder it drives
//! (`run_kaish` → `explore` → `consult`, with `deliberate`'s dossier stage sharing
//! the `explore` rung). Each rung adds exactly what its phase needs on top of the
//! one below — so a phase's signature names its config type and that alone tells a
//! reader what it touches, instead of every phase sharing one bundle and carrying
//! fields inert to it (the shape this replaced: `explore`/`deliberate` filled
//! `synth_max_turns`/`attachments` with dummies just to satisfy a two-phase
//! `consult`'s type, and `oneshot` filled four).
